                I have worked on multiple projects for coursework at RIT and a few side projects, which you can check out below. You can also check out
                most of these on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/shreyasj2006">GitHub</a>! Some of the projects listed here are not available on

                        <b><i>Vehicular Route Guidance using Traffic Prediction.</i></b> Implemented a route guidance system in Java by evaluating three
                        different re-routing algorithms which use traffic prediction data to avoid traffic congestions. SUMO – Simulation of Urban
                        Mobility was used for simulation of traffic, TraCI – Traffic Control Interface was used as a client for SUMO and TraaS – Traci
                        as a Service, a java library for TraCI was used to generate and run the simulation.

                        <b><i>Parallel Programming Solution to the Graph Coloring Problem.</i></b> Implemented a parallel algorithm for the Graph Coloring
                        problem in Java using the pj2 library, which colors the vertices of a graph in polynomial time but reduces the absolute
                        running time proportional to the number of processors used to color the graph. Worked in a team of 2 for this project.

                        from sensors connected to a server running on Raspberry Pi and controls the blinds in the room as per the set fuzzy logic
                        rules. An Android client was developed to give the user an UI which interacts with the server. The server was built using pi4j
                        and JSONRPC2 java library was used for communication between Android application and the server.

                        <b><i>Improved Bully Algorithm.</i></b> Implemented an improved version of Bully algorithm in Java, in a team of 3, which reduces the number of
                        messages passed from O(n<sup>2</sup>) to O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the network, to find a process with the highest ID to
                        be elected as the new leader for a shared resource in a distributed network. Java RMI was used for networking nodes.

                        Color Histogram method where Haar wavelets are used to compute horizontal, vertical and approximate coefficients,
                        and then these coefficients are weighted and Histogram Intersection Distance method is used to identify similar images from
                        a huge database of images. Matlab was used to develop the system.
